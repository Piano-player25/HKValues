{ "name": "Justice warriorism",
  "desc": "Unlike SJWs, Real Justice Warriors (or RJWs for short) are moderate and hold some pretty based beliefs. They are against racism, segregation, homophobia, transphobia, etc. and believe people should be held accountable for what they say online. They usually like gay/lesbian ships, Pride Month, Pride flags, and most of the stuff related to the LGBT+ community. They also lean towards left-wing economic policies in general, and believe positive liberties are at least as important, if not more than negative liberties.",

{ "name": "SJWism",
  "desc": "SJWs pretend to fight for freedom, but would immediately censor anyone who does not agree with them if given the occasion. They like when the government takes measures against right-wingers, left-wingers who don't agree with them (aka the vast majority), and basically anyone they don't like (always saying it is the 'far right'). SJWs are actually for the most part racist, since they support 'affirmative action' events reserved to blacks, but not events reserved to whites or any other ethnicty. Some of them are also anti-asian, which is really funny considering they claim to be defenders of 'social justice'.",

They would support the DPRK, but think it is still far too capitalist for them. When people express opinions that do not fall within the agenda of the Reddit mods, they instantly get banned.",

  "desc": "Hollow Knight Conservatism is based around the idea that the developers' intentions when making the game should be highly respected. They highly oppose any 'Rule 34' art, and usually oppose non-canon ship art as well. Some of them are anti-meme, as they believe it can corrupt the moral fiber of the game, although others may enjoy memeing from time to time. They usually have a high amount of respect for Team Cherry and their work, and hate it when people beg for more trailers or communication about Silksong.",
